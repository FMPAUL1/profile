<p>I'm Abel Paul, a software developer based in Abuja, Nigeria. Originally hailing from Rivers State, I've always had a passion for technology and coding. With a strong background in software development and proficiency in various programming languages such as Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, React, Node.js, and Python, I strive to create innovative and efficient solutions for my clients.

I am a certified data analyst, enabling me to leverage my analytical skills and technical expertise to extract valuable insights from complex datasets. This combination of software development and data analysis allows me to provide comprehensive solutions that address both the technical and analytical aspects of a project.

My journey in the tech industry began in 2021 as a Junior Data Analyst with PTDF during my NYSC (National Youth Service Corps) program. Working alongside experienced professionals, I gained hands-on experience in analyzing and interpreting data to drive strategic decision-making.

In 2022, I joined ATPTechHub as a Software Developer, where I honed my programming skills and contributed to the development of various projects. This role provided me with opportunities to collaborate with talented individuals and work on cutting-edge technologies, further enhancing my capabilities as a developer.

Prior to my venture into the world of software development, I obtained a degree in Petroleum Engineering from Rivers State University in 2020. While my educational background may seem divergent from my current profession, it has instilled in me a strong foundation of problem-solving skills and a keen attention to detail, qualities that are indispensable in the world of software development.

With a passion for continuous learning and a commitment to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends, I am constantly expanding my knowledge and skill set. I believe that embracing new technologies and adopting best practices are essential for delivering exceptional results to my clients.
